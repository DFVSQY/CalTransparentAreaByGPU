# 简介

该项目使用 Compute Shader 进行纹理透明区域占比的计算。相较于使用 CPU 计算纹理透明区域占比有以下优势：
* 无需设置纹理为可读写
* 计算过程高度并行化

如果你可以从该项目中受益，请为我点亮一颗 Star，谢谢！

This project utilizes Compute Shader for calculating the proportion of transparent areas in textures. Compared to calculating the proportion of transparent areas in textures using the CPU, it has the following advantages:

* No need to set the texture as Read/Write.
* The calculation process is highly parallelized.

If you can benefit from this project, please give me a Star, thank you!
